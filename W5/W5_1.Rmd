```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This part of the course will be heavily based on the book [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). They also have a nice slack channel where people interact and help each other [r4ds slack channel](https://rfordatascience.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt_fehdgdo3-mQK182iIk5Q7TIAy58Vgeg#/).

This chapter could also be names 'tidyverse', since this package will facilitate our work in manipulating and visualizing our dta.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
flights
as.data.frame(flights)
```

#Dplyr

```{r}
(sqrt(2) ^ 2) == 2
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2, 2)
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, NA, 7)
x[x=="NA"]
x=="NA"
is.na(x)
```

```{r}
#subset January data
flights[month == 1 & day == 1,]
flights[flights$month == 1 & flights$day == 1,]

#with dplyr
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))

filter(flights, month == (11 | 12))
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)

arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```
